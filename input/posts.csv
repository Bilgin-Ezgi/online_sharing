I did everything I could... blocking and hitting. But  nothing worked. It felt like none of our practices during the year has helped. We've got to learn how to deal with those sneaky spikes better! I even remember so well that after the game, our coach blamed us for playing badly. Nobody could speak up. We all just stayed silent. The four-hour bus ride back was really unbearable 😢😢😢 ",0.jpg,M.Kapadia92,-11:02:03,

Rejection from The Boston Conservatory at Berklee... 😢😢 the summer theater school I'd been counting on. I just couldn't believe it. My stomach flipped. I didn’t even wanna eat my pizza anymore. My friends tried to cheer me up though but... Anyway. We ended up leaving early. I spent the rest of the day thinking about the chance I felt like I lost. Sometimes dreams don’t work out. It was one of those days😔",165.jpg,Smitty12,-12:10:00,

112,"During my first year of high school, I learned a tough lesson about teamwork 😔 There were four of us in our project group, but soon it became clear I was the only one taking it seriously. I ended up doing all the work while the others barely lifted a finger. On presentation day, my teammates were late. Leaving me to present sections I hadn't even prepared. Those were their responsibility. PLUS, the professor graded us as a group, not individually. We received a truly unfair grade that didn’t reflect my effort at all. That experience turned me off group projects for a while. And no, we’re not friends anymore",pizza.jpg,john73,-6:53:00,

Do you know the worst part???? The professor announced everyone’s name and grade in front of the whole class. When she got to mine, I felt my heart drop. I was sitting all the way in the back, trying to sink into my chair and just disappear. My face was burning. I wanted to walk out so bad. But I was too stunned to even move.

So we had to take on four seniors with just me and my freshman friend. The game was back and forth, but we were hanging close. Finally we were at 22-21 and the ball in our hands. I drove through, took the shot, and nailed it!The crowd went nuts and stormed the floor. It was the closest I ever got to winning anything like a championship. It was awesome :D",885.jpg,john73,-18:20:00,

It began with a lot of fun, but then I fell off my horse. I hurt my wrist and we ended up at the hospital. After waiting for 2 hours, the doctor told me I injured my wrist. I think this was my first and last ride. Horses are very beautiful... BUT I realized they're not for me.
